# realise-feb-2018-challenge
Web Development Challenge
February 2018


This month the challenge will be to build an interactive project in collaborative isolation. Each entrant will be given a number of isolated problems to solve that once combined with other peoples pieces will be put together to (hopefully) solve the solution.

Each of the pieces will normally represent a function to write in JavaScript. These range in complexity but should be achievable by most, if not all,  of the entrants.

If you are interested in partaking in the challenge please respond and include a involvement rating:

Involvement Ratings
1 - Don’t have much time / experience just give me something simple
2 - Have some time but not looking for anything taxing
3 - Looking for practice, give me something mid range
4 - I want a challenge that’s within my reach
5 - Give me the most complex challenge that you’ve got

Please don’t worry if you can’t afford to give much time, each task is designed to take less than an hour to complete, some will probably be 5 minute jobs. There will be no judgement, a main goal of the exercise is to make it open to as many people.

Dependant on the range of ratings submitted I may have to duplicate some tasks, but I will use the best example of each in the final program.
Please refrain from trying to work out the final result with your peers, save it for the big reveal.
